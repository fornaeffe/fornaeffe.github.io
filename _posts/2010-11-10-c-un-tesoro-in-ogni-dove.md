People.  
Extraordinary treasures.  
Tiny but tough beings, books and writers of everyday incredible stories, where you also have a part, even drinking a cup of tea togheter in a november foggy day.  
  
And don't you feel receiving an undeserved honour, when you sit by someone, just a friend, who tried the storm climbing a mountain, or swam in Red Sea, or has been bitten by the sun of the desert, or simply feared for his life, worked for a better world, loved; and now is 'only' a person next to you, so close...?
